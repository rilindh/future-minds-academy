                        <p>The Blue Eye is a natural spring with a mesmerizing turquoise color that blends perfectly
                            with the
                            dark blue coming from its depth. It's one of the most beautiful places in Albania, and it
                            has been
                            described
                            as magical and hypnotic.
                            When seen from above, the spring resembles the human eye, so it was called Syri I Kaltër
                            ,which
                            means The blue eye in Albanian.
