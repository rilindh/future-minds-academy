    <h2 style="color: blue;"><u>Paris Saint-Germain</u></h2>
    <p style="color: white;">
        On 10 August, <em>Messi</em> joined French club Paris Saint-Germain. He signed a two-year deal until June 2023
        with an
        option for an extra year.[324] <em>Messi</em> chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when
        he made
        his senior debut for Barcelona.

        A new life for the man who spent almost his entire career at Barcelona, winning everything in his path.It's a
        new life that he has been groping his way through, during a first season that would be crowned with his first
        French league title - the tenth in the club's history - and the Ballon d'Or - his seventh - a unique achievement
        that is likely to remain etched in stone.

        Leo brought the Parc des Princes to its feet with his vision, his acceleration and his technique, always
        accurate and deadly. His marvellous left foot got the better of so many goalkeepers, and it's hard not to
        remember that last-second free-kick against Lille, in a memorable match that saw Paris win 4-3 after a
        white-knuckle finish.

        It was a story that ended with yet another title - the club's 46th and <em>Messi's</em> 43rd - making him one of
        the most
        successful players in the history of football.
