            <h2 id="1p">Project 1</h2>
            <p>In this project, I've created a webpage showcasing three captivating tourist destinations in Albania.
                Through
                a visually appealing and informative design, I've highlighted the beauty and cultural richness of these
                places. Each destination is presented with captivating images and engaging descriptions to inspire
                travelers
                to explore the wonders of Albania. This project represents my passion for promoting the hidden gems of
                my
                homeland to a global audience.</p>

            <h2 id="2p">Project 2</h2>
            <p>In this project, I've crafted a page dedicated to the iconic footballer Lionel Messi. The landing page
                presents a concise write-up about Messi, complemented by an audio segment and a video montage of some of
                his
                most stunning goals. Users can seamlessly navigate the site to delve into Messi's life story, the clubs
                he
                has played for, and some of his standout statistics. This project honors one of the football world's
                living
                legends, offering a comprehensive overview of his life, career, and extraordinary accomplishments.</p>

            <h2 id="3p">Project 3</h2>
            <p>This project showcases a webpage dedicated to the web development course that I'm currently enrolled in.
                The
                page provides a brief introduction to the course, outlining two major programming directions that
                students
                can pursue. It includes a write-up describing the course content and objectives. Towards the end of the
                page, users can find your contact details and the course location depicted using Google Maps.</p>
